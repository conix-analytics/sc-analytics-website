With a background in Bayesian analysis, biodiversity science, and the digital humanities, I help make complex data understandable and actionable — from marketing effectiveness and experimentation to research evaluation and policy analysis. I care deeply about transparency and open science, and aim to make every analysis both rigorous and reproducible.

I am currently developing a Bayesian marketing mix model and broader marketing analytics for a Belgian retail chain."""
